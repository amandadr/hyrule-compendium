This is a fun way to browse an encyclopedia of all the in-game interactive items in the world of Hyrule.

Updated 2024-03-21: Integrated a Lambda-hosted fuzzy search function which filters search terms before requesting entries from the API. This allows users to input partial terms or typos and return accurate results!

## Suggestions?

I'll be working on this one continuously, using it as a training project - as I learn, please send me any suggestions you may have to improve the app!

Refactoring, libraries, React states - I'm still getting a grip on it all, I appreciate any nudges in the right direction you might have to offer :)
